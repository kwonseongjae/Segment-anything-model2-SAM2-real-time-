# SAM 2: Real-time Inference without Chromakey

## Segment Anything Model2(SAM2)를 참고하여 real-time에서 실시간 통신을 통해 객체를 인식하고 크로마키 배경인 RGB(0,175,57)를 추가해여 크로마키 배경판이 없이도 크로마키 효과를 보일 수 있게 기능을 추가 하였다. 

(With reference to Segment Anything Model2 (SAM2), we added a function to recognize objects through real-time communication in real-time and add RGB (0,175,57), which is a chroma key background, so that the chroma key effect can be displayed without a chroma key background.) 

# 기존의 SAM2을 사용하기 위해선 SAM2(https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2.git)를 참고하여 clone 및 GPU환경을 셋팅하기를 바란다

**Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)** is a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. We extend SAM to video by considering images as a video with a single frame. The model design is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. We build a model-in-the-loop data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect [**our SA-V dataset**](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything-video), the largest video segmentation dataset to date. SAM 2 trained on our data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks and visual domains.
